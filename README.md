## Project Overview  
This project analyzes the relationship between Pulitzer Prizes won by newspapers and their circulation trends over time. Using data on newspaper circulation from 2004 and 2013 along with Pulitzer Prize counts from 1990 to 2014, the project explores circulation changes, statistical associations, and regression modeling to provide insights into the media industry.

## Dataset  
- `pulitzer.csv` — Contains data on 45 major US newspapers including circulation figures, percent change, and Pulitzer Prizes won.  

---

## Analysis  
- Data cleaning and transformation of circulation change values.  
- Visualization of circulation and change distributions.  
- Linear regression modeling to predict circulation metrics based on Pulitzer Prize counts.  
- Diagnostic checks for model assumptions.  
- Interpretation of results and discussion of implications.
